# A NES emulator in C++

# Credits

This project is very based off javidx9's own NES emulator. This project is purely for me learning about how the NES works in detail.
Big thanks to him for his series on [youtube]() and [open-source code](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES).

This project uses javidx9's [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) for rendering.
