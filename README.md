# A NES emulator in C++

# Credits

This project is very based off javidx9's own NES emulator. This project is purely for me learning about how the NES works in detail.
Big thanks to him for his series on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nViZg02IMQo&list=PLrOv9FMX8xJHqMvSGB_9G9nZZ_4IgteYf) and [open-source code](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES).

Thanks to the maker of [Fergulator](https://github.com/scottferg/Fergulator) for the collection of test roms.

This project uses javidx9's [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) for rendering.
